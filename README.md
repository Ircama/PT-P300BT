# Printing to a Brother P-Touch Cube PT-P300BT label printer from a computer

## Introduction

The [Brother P-touch Cube PT-P300BT labelling machine](https://support.brother.com/g/b/producttop.aspx?c=gb&lang=en&prod=p300bteuk) is intended to be controlled from the official Brother P-touch Design&Print 2 app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brother.ptouch.designandprint2) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/brother-p-touch-design-print/id1105307806) devices.

This repository provides a command-line tool in pure Python to print from a computer. It is based on the scripts included in the following Gists:

- [PT-P300BT gist](https://gist.github.com/Ircama/bd53c77c98ecd3d7db340c0398b22d8a)
- [dogtopus/Pipfile gist](https://gist.github.com/dogtopus/64ae743825e42f2bb8ec79cea7ad2057)
- [stecman gist](https://gist.github.com/stecman/ee1fd9a8b1b6f0fdd170ee87ba2ddafd)

The scripts convert text labels to appropriate images compatible with 12mm width craft tapes like [TZe-131](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/tze131) or [TZe-231](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/tze231), tuned for the max allowed character size with this printer. The scripts also include the code to drive the printer via serial Bluetooth interface.

Comparing with the PT-P300BT gist, it uses *printlabel.py*, which does not create a temporary image file and does not need ImageMagick; also, *printlabel.cmd* and *printlabel.sh* are not used.

Two font sizes are used, depending on the character sequence; the smaller font is selected when characters [overshoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_(typography)) below the [baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(typography)).

Standard usage: `python3 printlabel.py COM_PORT FONT_NAME TEXT_TO_PRINT`

The tested font name is "arial.ttf". Examples:

```
python3 printlabel.py COM7 "arial.ttf" "Lorem Ipsum"
```

or:

```
printlabel.exe COM7 "arial.ttf" "Lorem Ipsum"
```

In addition, all options included in *labelmaker.py* are available.

```
usage: printlabel.py [-h] [-s] [-i IMAGE] [-n] [-F] [-a] [-m END_MARGIN] [-r] [-C] COM_PORT FONT_NAME TEXT_TO_PRINT

positional arguments:
  COM_PORT              Printer COM port.
  FONT_NAME             Pathname of the used TrueType font.
  TEXT_TO_PRINT         Text to be printed.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --show            Show the created image and quit.
  -i IMAGE, --image IMAGE
                        Image file to print. If this option is used, TEXT_TO_PRINT is ignored.
  -n, --no-print        Only configure the printer and send the image but do not send print command.
  -F, --no-feed         Disable feeding at the end of the print (chaining).
  -a, --auto-cut        Enable auto-cutting (or print label boundary on e.g. PT-P300BT).
  -m END_MARGIN, --end-margin END_MARGIN
                        End margin (in dots).
  -r, --raw             Send the image to printer as-is without any pre-processing.
  -C, --nocomp          Disable compression.
```

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/Ircama/PT-P300BT && cd PT-P300BT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Bluetooth printer connection on Windows

The following steps allow connecting a Windows COM port to the Bluetooth printer.

- Open Windows Settings
- Go to Bluetooth & devices
- Press "View more devices"
- Press "More Bluetooth settings"
- Select "COM Ports" tab
- Press Add... (wait for a while)
- Select Ongoing
- Press Browse...
- Search for PT-P300BT9000 and select it
- Select PT-P300BT9000
- Service: Serial
- Read the name of the COM port
- Press OK
- Press OK

Perform the device peering. 

## Usage on WSL

Pair the printer with an RFCOMM COM port using the Windows Bluetooth panel.

Check the outbound RFCOMM COM port number and use it to define /dev/ttyS_serial_port_number; for instance, COM5 is /dev/ttyS5.

Usage: `python3 printlabel.py /dev/ttyS_serial_port_number FONT_NAME TEXT_TO_PRINT`

## Bluetooth printer connection on Ubuntu

Connect the printer via [Ubuntu Bluetooth panel](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/bluetooth-connect-device.html.en) (e.g., Settings, Bluetooth).

To read the MAC address: `hcitool scan`. Setup /dev/rfcomm0.

Usage: `python3 printlabel.py /dev/rfcomm0 FONT_NAME TEXT_TO_PRINT`

## Creating an executable asset for the GUI

To build an executable file via [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/), first install *pyinstaller* with `pip install pyinstaller`.

The *printlabel.spec* file helps building the executable program. Run it with the following command.

```
pip install pyinstaller  # if not yet installed
pyinstaller printlabel.spec
```

Then run the executable file created in the *dist/* folder.

This repository includes a Windows *printlabel.exe* executable file which is automatically generated by a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/Ircama/PT-P300BT/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml). It is packaged in a ZIP file named *printlabel.zip* and uploaded into the [Releases](https://github.com/Ircama/PT-P300BT/releases/latest) folder.
